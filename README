Patch to extend the pam_krb5 compile options and functionality

Assists with UID/GID mapping for users that are not stored
locally, but within an LDAP directory. Supports RFC2307
POSIX account schema attributes for uid, gid, homeDirectory,
and defaultShell.

In order to enable this functionality simply run the configure
command with the --with-ldap argument like so.

./configure --with-ldap

This will enable the linking against the required ldap.h and 
-lldap libraries and provide LDAP UID/GID mapping.

In addition to enabling this feature a simple configuration is
required within the krb5.conf appdefaults section. An example
is listed here:

[appdefaults]
pam = {
        ticket_lifetime = 1d
        renew_lifetime = 1d
        forwardable = true
        proxiable = false
        retain_after_close = false
        minimum_uid = 2
        try_first_pass = true
        ignore_root = true

        schema = ad #ad | ldap to meet your requirements
        ldapservs = ad.domain.com ldap.domain.com
        ldapport = 389
        binddn = uid=read-only-user,ou=Users,dc=ldap,dc=domain,dc=com
        basedn = ou=campus,dc=ad,dc=domain,dc=com
        ldapuser = [readonly-username]
        ldappass = [readonly-password]
        
        passwd = /etc/passwd
        shadow = /etc/shadow

	# If you wish to add the user to groups
	# a comma separted list should be used
	group = /etc/group
	groups = audio,cdrom,cdrw,usb,plugdev,video,games

        # If you define these they will
        # over write anything obtained from
        # ldap/active directory
        #homedir = /home
        #defshell = /bin/bash
}
