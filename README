Patch to extend the pam_krb5 compile options and functionality

Assists with UID/GID mapping for users that are not stored
locally, but within an LDAP directory. Supports RFC2307
POSIX account schema attributes for uid, gid, homeDirectory,
and defaultShell.

Installation:
1. Pull down the latest pam_krb5 git repo like so:
git clone git://git.fedorahosted.org/pam_krb5.git

2. Pull down the latest patch to add ldap uid/gid mapping:
git clone git@github.com:jas-/pam_krb5-ldap.git

3. Apply the patch (must be in same folder, and may need
   to rename the pam_krb5 git repo folder to pam_krb5-2.3.12+ldap)
patch -p0 > date-pam_krb5-version.patch

4. Build necessary tools for build
./autogen

5. In order to enable this functionality simply run the configure
   command with the --with-ldap argument like so.
./configure --with-ldap

This will enable the linking against the required ldap.h and 
-lldap libraries and provide LDAP UID/GID mapping.

6. Install the authentication module
make install

7. Add LDAP specific data to /etc/krb5.conf appdefaults section.
An example is listed here:

[appdefaults]
pam = {
        ticket_lifetime = 1d
        renew_lifetime = 1d
        forwardable = true
        proxiable = false
        retain_after_close = false
        minimum_uid = 2
        try_first_pass = true
        ignore_root = true

        schema = ad #ad | ldap to meet your requirements
        ldapservs = ad.domain.com ldap.domain.com
        ldapport = 389
        binddn = uid=read-only-user,ou=Users,dc=ldap,dc=domain,dc=com
        basedn = ou=campus,dc=ad,dc=domain,dc=com
        ldapuser = [readonly-username]
        ldappass = [readonly-password]
        
        passwd = /etc/passwd
        shadow = /etc/shadow

	# If you wish to add the user to groups
	# a comma separted list should be used
	group = /etc/group
	groups = audio,cdrom,cdrw,usb,plugdev,video,games

        # If you define these they will
        # over write anything obtained from
        # ldap/active directory
        #homedir = /home
        #defshell = /bin/bash
}
